# Pointer basics

Write a function with the below signature that reads a pointer of type `*bool`and returns its value (of type `bool`).

``` go
func retrieveValue(pinter *bool) bool {
	// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
}
```

Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` at the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
