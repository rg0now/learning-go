# Message Queue

You have to implement a message queue that takes three inputs from different source channels and create an array that consists of the actual value of the inputs.

Write a function that accepts three arguments, the three source channels. These are: `A`, `B` and `C`, each of them represented by a `string` value which is the actual message. The function should return an array of strings, in which the order of the elements is the following:

`{ A, C, B }`

Place your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
